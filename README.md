## Introduction
Airbnb is a popular online marketplace for renting vacation homes, apartments, and lodging. 
The data collected from Airbnb listings can provide valuable information about rental trends, guest preferences, and host performances. 
This project aims to clean the raw Airbnb data, handle missing values, and perform data analysis to extract meaningful insights.

### Problem
The Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis Project aims to clean and analyze raw Airbnb data to provide valuable insights and trends in the vacation rental market. 
The dataset contains diverse information related to Airbnb listings, including property details, amenities, guest ratings, and pricing. 
By addressing missing data, handling inconsistencies, and performing data analysis, this project seeks to transform the raw data into a structured and meaningful format.
Specifically, we want to address the following:

- How can we handle missing data and inconsistencies in the raw Airbnb dataset?
- How can we extract meaningful insights and patterns from the cleaned dataset?
- How can we identify trends in the vacation rental market, such as pricing patterns, amenities preferences, and guest ratings?
- How can we provide a user-friendly solution for exploring and visualizing the data?

### Solution
**Data Cleaning:** 
- The project starts by loading the raw Airbnb dataset and identifying missing values and data inconsistencies.
- A comprehensive data cleaning process is implemented to handle missing data, convert data types, and remove inconsistencies.
- The cleaning script saves the cleaned data as "clean_tabular_data.csv" to facilitate further analysis.
**Data Analysis and Visualization:**

**Label Selection:**
The user can specify a target label column (e.g., "Price_Night") during the data analysis, which will be separated from the features for further exploration.
This allows users to focus on specific aspects of the rental market, such as pricing trends, while analyzing other features separately.
**User-Friendly Implementation:**
The project provides user-friendly scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
Users can easily run the scripts by executing straightforward commands, making the project accessible and usable by individuals with varying levels of programming experience.

Through the Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis Project, users gain access to a cleaned and structured dataset with valuable insights into the vacation rental market. 
By addressing missing data, performing thorough analysis, and providing visualizations, the project allows property owners, travelers, investors, and data enthusiasts to explore trends, make informed decisions, and gain a deeper understanding of the Airbnb market.
The user-friendly implementation and data exploration capabilities make the project a valuable resource for anyone interested in the vacation rental market. 
Whether you are looking to optimize your rental offerings, plan your travels, or analyze investment opportunities, this project equips you with the tools to gain actionable insights from Airbnb data.

### Target Users
The target users of this project are individuals or organizations interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the Airbnb rental market. 
Potential users include:

**Property Owners and Hosts:** Hosts looking to optimize their rental offerings by understanding pricing trends, amenities preferences, and guest ratings.
**Travelers and Guests:** Travelers seeking valuable insights into popular locations, amenities availability, and the overall quality of accommodations.
**Real Estate Investors:** Investors exploring potential investment opportunities in the vacation rental market.
**Data Enthusiasts:** Individuals interested in data analysis, visualization, and gaining insights from real-world datasets.

## Major Features
**Data Cleaning:** The project includes a comprehensive data cleaning process to address missing values, convert data types, and handle inconsistencies in the raw dataset.
**Data Analysis and Visualization:** After cleaning the data, the project performs statistical analysis and generates insightful visualizations to highlight trends, patterns, and correlations within the Airbnb market.
**Label Selection:** The user can specify a target label column (e.g., "Price_Night") for analysis, which will be separated from the features for further exploration.
**Data Saving:** The cleaned data is saved as "clean_tabular_data.csv" to facilitate future analysis and usage.
**Easy-to-Use:** The scripts for data cleaning and analysis are user-friendly and can be executed with straightforward commands.

## Installation
To run the code in this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required and can be installed using pip:

pandas
numpy
To install the required libraries, use the following command:
pip install pandas numpy

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Millie-Jackson/airbnb-data-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd airbnb
Run the data cleaning and analysis scripts:
python tabular_data.py

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves removing missing values, converting data types, and handling inconsistencies. 
The tabular_data.py script reads the raw Airbnb dataset, performs cleaning operations, and saves the cleaned data as clean_tabular_data.csv.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis process aims to extract insights and patterns from the cleaned dataset. 
The tabular_data.py script loads the cleaned data, performs statistical analysis, and generates visualizations to understand trends in the Airbnb market.
